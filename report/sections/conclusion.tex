\section{Conclusion}

We presented two main timing attacks against RSA, one from Kocher published in 1995, and another from Brumley and Boneh, published in 2005.

First, we introduced some technical background needed to understand how the described attacks work.
Then, we showed Kocher's timing attack: a clear threat to cryptosystems popular in computer security applications when they are based on simple modular exponentiation algorithm.

In addition, we described how Brumley and Boneh made practical an attack to expose RSA private keys on applications based on OpenSSL, a library commonly used in web servers and other SSL application. Their work had a crucial impact on OpenSSL, as well as other crypto libraries, which now implement the defence blinding by default.
